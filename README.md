No More Boring Excel sheet or Head Scratches !
Turn Pricing Talks into Clarity, Not Chaos !!

This page has been created with one main goal: to make price discussions easier, faster, and more accurate. For a long time, we have relied on spreadsheets for calculations. While they are useful, they can also be slow, feel outdated, and sometimes confusingâ€”especially during client meetings, when clarity is most important.

The calculators introduced here are designed to solve that problem. They help reduce manual work, avoid mistakes, and present information in a clear and simple way. With these tools, you can manage implementation service pricing, set discounts wisely to meet your quarterly targets, and review the results after any negotiation.

My hope is that this tool will not only save time but also make client conversations smoother and more professional.

I welcome your feedback and suggestions for improvement, and I am always happy to connect on Discord (trigram ATSH).
